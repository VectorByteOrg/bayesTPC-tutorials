## bayesTPC Tutorial Examples

This page showcases a series of practical examples that demonstrate how to use the `bayesTPC` package for fitting thermal performance curves (TPCs) to biological trait data. These examples are drawn from hands-on training sessions and real-world use cases, and are intended to guide new users in applying `bayesTPC` to their own datasets.

Whether you are just getting started or exploring more advanced features, these materials walk through key modeling steps using curated datasets.

## VectorByte Training Workshop

This short activity was developed as part of the VectorByte training series. It introduces basic usage of `bayesTPC` in the context of modeling mosquito traits.

-   **Dataset**: [*Aedes aegypti* trait data](data/AeaegyptiTraitData.csv)

## EEID 2024 Workshop

The following materials were used during the 2024 EEID (Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases) workshop. They include both an introductory walkthrough and an advanced module demonstrating model customization.

### Basic Usage: Fitting TPCs with `bayesTPC`

-   **Practical**: [Introductory example](EEID2024_basic.qmd)

### Advanced Usage: Exploring Custom Models

This activity goes beyond basic fitting to explore advanced options in `bayesTPC`, including likelihood customization and visual diagnostics.
