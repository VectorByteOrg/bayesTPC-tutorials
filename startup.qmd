# Welcome

This site serves as a self-contained tutorial for using the `bayesTPC` R package — a flexible, powerful tool for fitting **Bayesian thermal performance curves (TPCs)**. It was originally developed to support **trait-based modeling of vector-borne diseases** (see our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13861)), but it works for any system where temperature-dependent trait modeling is needed.

Whether you're joining one of our workshops or exploring independently, this guide will help you get started.


## What is bayesTPC?

The `bayesTPC` package provides a general framework for fitting thermal performance curves with uncertainty via **Bayesian MCMC inference**. Key features include:

- Predefined model types (e.g., Brière, Quadratic, Gaussian) and modular customization
- Built-in MCMC sampling via [`nimble`](https://r-nimble.org/)
- Posterior summarization, prediction, and diagnostic visualization
- Clean API with helper functions for data prep and reproducibility

If you are working with trait data that varies with temperature (like survival, development rate, or fecundity), this package is built to help.


## What This Tutorial Includes

This tutorial site includes:

- Installation & Setup: How to get the package running  
- Core Usage: Loading and formatting data, fitting models  
- Plotting & Prediction: Creating visualizations from model output  
- Advanced Features: Posterior predictions, T<sub>pk</sub> extraction, and more  
- Workshop Materials: Live example walkthroughs from EEID and VectorByte training sessions  

You can follow the tutorial linearly or jump into the [Materials](materials.qmd) section to start working with data.

## Pre-work and Setup

### Software

You will need:

- [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- A preferred R IDE (we recommend [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/))
- The ability to install packages from GitHub (via `devtools` or `remotes`)

If you're attending a workshop, we’ll also use:

- Slack for support and communication
- GitHub for accessing and submitting materials


### Recommended Background

This tutorial assumes some familiarity with:

- Core R syntax
- Reading in data, basic plotting, using packages
- Introductory statistics, including linear regression and distributions

#### R Refresher:
