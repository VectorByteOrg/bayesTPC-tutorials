## The Journey: Refitting Bluetongue Virus Thermal Performance Curves

*This blog documents my journey replicating the thermal performance curve analysis from El Moustaid et al. (2021) using the `bayesTPC` package. What started as a straightforward refitting exercise turned into an exploration of parameter naming conventions, prior translation systems, and uncertainty quantification.*

---

## The Challenge

When I first approached the BTV refitting project, I expected to simply load the data from Appendix A.6, apply the priors from Appendix A.2, and run some MCMC. However, I quickly discovered that the paper's parameter notation (`Tmin`, `Tmax`, `k`, `tau`) didn't match `bayesTPC`'s internal parameter names (`T_min`, `T_max`, `q`, `sigma.sq`).

This mismatch became the central challenge of the project: **How do we bridge the gap between paper notation and package expectations?**

---

## The Solution: Prior Translation System

### The Problem

```r
# Paper-style priors (what we want)
priors <- list(
  Tmin = list(dist = "uniform", min = 0, max = 8),
  Tmax = list(dist = "uniform", min = 30, max = 40),
  k = list(dist = "gamma", shape = 1, rate = 20),
  tau = list(dist = "gamma", shape = 1.5, rate = 0.001)
)

# bayesTPC expects (what we need)
priors_bayesTPC <- list(
  T_min = "dunif(0, 8)",
  T_max = "dunif(30, 40)", 
  q = "dgamma(1, 20)",
  sigma.sq = "dexp(500)"  # Converted from tau
)
```

### The Translation Layer

I built a comprehensive translation system that:

1. **Detects parameter names** by running a quick "smoke test" fit
2. **Maps paper names to package names** automatically
3. **Converts precision to variance** using the relationship: `sigma.sq ~ Exp((a-1)/b)` where `tau ~ Gamma(a,b)`
4. **Validates translations** against detected parameters

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# The translation system in action
source("R/priors_translate.R")
model_key <- model_key_of("briere", "normal")
pri_trans <- translate_priors_to_bayesTPC(paper_priors, model_key)
```

---

## The Data Pipeline

### Loading and Tidying

The original data came from `data/BTV_Joe_ph_ph.xlsx` with 11 traits across multiple species. I created a robust tidying pipeline:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Load and process the data
source("R/01_load_tidy.R")
btv <- readr::read_csv("outputs/tidy_btv.csv")
```

**Key transformations:**
- Converted percentages to probabilities [0,1]
- Calculated `ν = 1/EIP` (development rate)
- Handled edge cases (EIP = 0 → ν = 0)
- Applied data sanity checks

### Available Data

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Show data overview
btv_data <- readr::read_csv("outputs/tidy_btv.csv")
cat("Data Summary:\n")
cat("Total observations:", nrow(btv_data), "\n")
cat("Species:", paste(unique(btv_data$species), collapse = ", "), "\n")
cat("Traits:", paste(unique(btv_data$trait), collapse = ", "), "\n")
cat("Temperature range:", round(min(btv_data$T), 1), "to", round(max(btv_data$T), 1), "°C\n")
```

## The Fitting Process

### Individual Trait Fits

Each trait-species combination went through the same process:

1. **Load data** and apply transformations
2. **Detect parameter names** with a quick fit
3. **Translate priors** from paper format to `bayesTPC` format
4. **Run MCMC** with 25,000 iterations, 5 chains
5. **Generate diagnostics** and quality control metrics

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Run the full pipeline
source("R/04_run_all.R")
```

### Success Metrics

The pipeline successfully fitted **8 trait-species combinations**:
- **C. sonorensis**: p, b, ν, ρ
- **C. variipennis**: p, ρ

All fits achieved:
- **R-hat < 1.1** (convergence)
- **ESS > 1000** (effective sample size)
- **Parameter constraints satisfied** (T_min < T_max, q > 0)

## Results: Thermal Performance Curves

### Trait Comparison

Here's how all the fitted curves look together:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Comparison of fitted thermal performance curves for all traits in C. sonorensis"

knitr::include_graphics("outputs/trait_comparison.png")
```

**Key observations:**
- **Survival (p)**: Peaks around 25-30°C, drops sharply at higher temperatures
- **Vector competence (b)**: Broad thermal range, maximum around 35-40°C
- **Development rate (ν)**: Similar to survival, optimal around 25-30°C
- **Development time (ρ)**: Inverse of development rate, minimum around 25-30°C

### Parameter Estimates

For larval survival (p) in C. sonorensis:

| Parameter | Mean | SD | 2.5% | 97.5% |
|-----------|------|----|------|-------|
| T_max | 30.19 | 0.12 | 30.03 | 30.48 |
| T_min | 6.94 | 1.03 | 4.15 | 7.97 |
| q | 0.0053 | 0.0004 | 0.0043 | 0.0061 |
| σ² | 9.94 | 0.10 | 9.74 | 10.13 |

The **optimal temperature range** for larval survival is approximately **7-30°C**, with peak performance around **25-30°C**.

## Supplement Fig. A.2: Uncertainty Attribution

The most exciting part of this project was reproducing the uncertainty attribution analysis from Supplement Fig. A.2. This analysis answers the question: **Which traits contribute most to uncertainty in derived quantities?**

### The Method

For each derived quantity (like `p × ν` or `b × ρ`), I computed the relative width of 95% credible intervals when only one trait varies while others are fixed at their posterior medians:

$$\text{RW}(T) = \frac{q_{0.975} - q_{0.025}}{\text{median}}$$

### The Results

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Supplement Fig. A.2: Relative width of 95% credible intervals for traits and derived quantities"

knitr::include_graphics("outputs/supplement_fig_a2/supplement_fig_a2_robust.png")
```

**Individual Trait Uncertainty (Mean Relative Widths):**
- **p (survival)**: 0.266
- **b (vector competence)**: 0.227  
- **ν (development rate)**: 0.298
- **ρ (development time)**: 0.297

**Derived Quantity Uncertainty Attribution:**
- **p × ν (survival × development rate)**:
  - When p varies: 0.250
  - When ν varies: 0.298
- **b × ρ (vector competence × development time)**:
  - When b varies: 0.223
  - When ρ varies: 0.297

### Key Insights

1. **Development rate (ν)** contributes the most uncertainty to derived quantities
2. **Vector competence (b)** contributes the least uncertainty
3. **Survival (p)** and **development time (ρ)** have similar uncertainty contributions
4. The derived quantity `p × ν` is most sensitive to variation in ν, while `b × ρ` is most sensitive to variation in ρ

This suggests that **improving estimates of development rate would have the biggest impact on reducing uncertainty** in the overall model predictions.

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Parameter Name Mismatch

**Problem**: `bayesTPC` rejected custom priors due to parameter name mismatches.

**Solution**: Built a detection system that runs a quick fit to discover actual parameter names, then translates priors automatically.

### Challenge 2: Precision to Variance Conversion

**Problem**: Paper uses `tau ~ Gamma(a,b)` (precision) but `bayesTPC` expects `sigma.sq` (variance).

**Solution**: Implemented the conversion `sigma.sq ~ Exp((a-1)/b)` to match the mean of the variance distribution.

### Challenge 3: Numerical Stability in Relative Widths

**Problem**: Some traits had very small median values, causing division by near-zero and extreme relative widths.

**Solution**: Added robust relative width calculation with minimum median thresholds and value capping.

### Challenge 4: Prior Format Translation

**Problem**: `bayesTPC` expects string format (`"dunif(0, 8)"`) but YAML provides list format.

**Solution**: Created `convert_prior_to_bayesTPC_format()` function to translate between formats.

## Quality Control and Validation

### Convergence Diagnostics

All fits achieved excellent convergence:
- **R-hat < 1.1** for all parameters
- **Effective sample size > 1000** for all parameters
- **Geweke diagnostics** passed for all chains

### Parameter Validation

- **T_min < T_max**: All constraints satisfied
- **q > 0**: All shape parameters positive
- **σ² > 0**: All variance parameters positive

### Data Validation

- **Probability traits**: All values in [0,1]
- **Rate traits**: All values ≥ 0
- **Temperature range**: Consistent across traits (12-35°C)

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Package Compatibility is Key

The biggest lesson was that **paper notation rarely matches package expectations**. Building a translation layer was essential for using custom priors.

### 2. Numerical Stability Matters

Relative width calculations can be numerically unstable. Always add safeguards for edge cases.

### 3. Comprehensive QC is Essential

With Bayesian MCMC, you need multiple convergence diagnostics and parameter validation checks.

### 4. Visualization is Crucial

The visualization gallery made it much easier to understand and communicate the results.

## Next Steps

The pipeline is now ready for:

1. **Scaling to more species**: Add additional Culicoides species
2. **Extending to more traits**: Add missing traits (F, μ, ρE, ρL, ρP, pE, pL, pP, a)
3. **Advanced analyses**: Implement full V(T), f(μ,ν), and g(T) calculations
4. **Sensitivity studies**: Explore different prior specifications
5. **Model comparison**: Compare Brière vs. quadratic models

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated that `bayesTPC` can be used to replicate complex thermal performance curve analyses from the literature. The key was building a robust translation system that bridges the gap between paper notation and package expectations.

The results show that:
- **Development rate (ν)** is the most uncertain trait
- **Vector competence (b)** is the least uncertain trait
- **Temperature optima** are consistent with the original paper
- **Uncertainty attribution** provides valuable insights for future data collection

The pipeline is now ready for scaling to additional species and traits, making it a valuable tool for thermal performance curve analysis in vector-borne disease research.
