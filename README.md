This repository contains tutorials for the bayesTPC software package. 

## Overall Tasks

### Learning and Setup
- [ ] Learn how to use **bayesTPC** to fit TPCs
- [ ] Update and revise tutorial materials (copy into the new repository)

### Trait Data Aggregation
- [ ] Aggregate trait data related to **bluetongue**
- [ ] Check existing data sheets for completeness
- [ ] Redigitize any missing data from the original paper

### New Data Collection
- [ ] Find and digitize **newer trait data** for future inclusion

### bayesTPC Re-fitting
- [ ] Using the **bayesTPC** pipeline, **refit all TPCs** from the previous paper (only using original data)
- [ ] Write a **blog post guide**:
  - [ ] Explain how to use the pipeline
  - [ ] Demonstrate how to obtain **MAP estimators**
  - [ ] Emphasize utility for modelers in future studies

### BONUS Task
